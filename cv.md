### **About me** 
I'm a junior scientist in the National Botanical Garden, Minsk. I graduated as a microbiologist from Belarusian State University and i really like my speciality. Unfortunately, i don't work as a microbiologist because there are no work places.
Now i'm trying to change my life by studying JS and Front-end. It is a challenge for me because i've never ever succeed in programming even in school, when we were trying to understand Pascal ABC.
